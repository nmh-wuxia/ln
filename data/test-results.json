  "text": "\"Health, mana, magic power, damage reduction—all increased by 50%! Even for a legendary-grade item, this effect is absolutely insane!\"\n\nJiang Chen was no stranger to legendary equipment, but even in his past life, the base effects of the [Myriad·Primordial Robe] were the strongest he had ever seen!\n\nIt could be said that this was the ultimate gear for intelligence-based players.\n\nOf course, in terms of grade, above legendary was the mythical grade—divine artifacts. But purely in terms of base stats, divine artifacts weren’t particularly outstanding.\n\nSome divine artifacts didn’t even offer any stat bonuses at all.\n\nThe true strength of divine artifacts lay in their unique functions, each one-of-a-kind.\n\nMoreover, divine artifacts were incredibly rare—merely encountering one was difficult, let alone obtaining one. They were virtually priceless and impossible to find.\n\nTherefore, at any given time, legendary-grade equipment was undoubtedly the strongest gear players could realistically get their hands on.\n\nJiang Chen was quite satisfied with the base bonuses of the Primordial Robe, and his anxiety lessened somewhat.\n\nHe looked even more eagerly at the three additional effects of the equipment: Primordial Protection, Life Reversion, and Myriad Flow.\n\nImmediately, he opened the effect details.\n\n[Primordial Protection: All damage taken consumes an equal amount of mana instead of health. When mana reaches 0, gain 3 seconds of invincibility. Cooldown: 1 hour.]\n\n[Life Reversion: When receiving fatal damage and health drops to 0, health reverts to its value from 3 seconds ago. Cooldown: 1 hour.]\n\n[Myriad Flow: Allows conversion between health and mana. A single health or mana value cannot exceed the sum of both maximum values.\n\nNote: When Life Reversion is on cooldown, health cannot be converted to 0.]\n\nWith each additional effect he read, Jiang Chen’s eyes widened further. When he reached the final one, [Myriad Flow], his eyes narrowed slightly before widening even more, his heart swelling with ecstasy.\n\nEspecially that last line: [When Life Reversion is on cooldown, health cannot be converted to 0.]\n\nAt first glance, it seemed like a redundant statement—of course health couldn’t be 0. But upon second thought, if [Life Reversion] wasn’t on cooldown, could it be converted to 0?\n\nIn other words, could the health-mana conversion of [Myriad Flow] freely trigger the health recovery of [Life Reversion] and the invincibility of [Primordial Protection]?\n\nThe only slight confusion was the line: [A single health or mana value cannot exceed the sum of both maximum values.]\n\nHe’d have to test it out to understand its exact meaning.\n\nWith that in mind, Jiang Chen eagerly equipped the Primordial Robe.\n\nInstantly, a gray robe embroidered with black and white patterns appeared on his body, looking ancient and unremarkable.\n\nOnly an occasional shimmer of light swirling around it hinted at its extraordinary nature.\n\nOnce equipped, Jiang Chen’s health, mana, and magic power surged dramatically.\n\nHealth: 9390 (↑3130)\n\nMana: 14250 (↑4750)\n\nMagic Power: 1350 (↑450)\n\n\"Myriad Flow!\"\n\nJiang Chen silently invoked the skill, and his health and mana began to shift according to his will.\n\nHe tried converting 100 mana into health.\n\nThe moment the thought formed, his stats panel changed instantly.\n\nHealth: 9490 (↑100)\n\nMana: 14150 (↓100)\n\nHe tried again, converting all his mana into health!\n\nWith a single thought, his mana instantly dropped to 0, and his health skyrocketed to 23640!\n\nAt the same time, a thin, transparent glow enveloped Jiang Chen.\n\nHe had triggered the invincibility effect of Primordial Protection—when mana reached 0, he gained 3 seconds of invincibility!\n\nThree seconds later, the transparent glow faded.\n\nSuppressing his excitement, Jiang Chen tried once more.\n\nWith another thought, he chose to convert all his health into mana!\n\nInstantly, his mana, which had just been 0, shot up to 23640.\n\nHis health, however, dropped to 0. But the moment it hit 0, a brilliant white light erupted around Jiang Chen.\n\nHis health surged abruptly, returning to 23640!\n\nThis was the effect of [Life Reversion]—when health dropped to 0, it reverted to its value from 3 seconds prior.\n\nNow, Jiang Chen’s health and mana were both at 23640!\n\nThis conversion had doubled his total health and mana!\n\nCould he do it again?\n\nJiang Chen focused his will and tried once more.\n\n[Myriad Flow unavailable. Your health or mana cannot exceed the sum of both maximum values!]\n\nA system prompt appeared.\n\nJiang Chen immediately understood—after conversion, neither his health nor mana could exceed the sum of their maximum values, which was 23640.\n\nThat made sense. Without such a limit, infinite conversion and stat boosting would be like stepping on one’s own foot to climb into the sky—utterly broken.\n\nJiang Chen smiled faintly. Having figured out the effects of the Primordial Robe, he turned his attention to another item in his inventory—[Myriad·Undying Light].\n\nIt was a 9-star skill book!"
